# Ethereum Lottery Smart Contract ðŸŽ°

This is a simple **Lottery Smart Contract** built using Solidity. Participants can enter the lottery by sending **2 ETH**, and a manager can pick a random winner.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Minimum 3 participants required** before selecting a winner
- Uses `keccak256` for randomization (not truly random, but works for testing)
- Only the **manager** can check the contract balance and select a winner

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. Deploy the contract on **Remix IDE** or a **Testnet** (Goerli, Sepolia)
2. Participants enter by sending **2 ETH** (`receive()` function)
3. The **manager selects a winner**, and the contract transfers the prize money

## ðŸ“œ Smart Contract Code
Check the [`Lottery.sol`](./Lottery.sol) file for the full code.
